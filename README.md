## Overview

Blackjack Game with Windows User Interface.
This was a project made over 2021 winter to familiarize myself with C# and building small applications.
Player starts with 1000 dollars and can adjust their current bet using the slider. Upon each dealt hand, the player can then decide how to play the hand using the buttons available.

### Notes for a future version  

1) Separate files to improve readability
2) Implement a Split Feature
3) Separate classes out a lot more such that each class has their own function
4) Implement Design Pattern with inheritance such that this project maintains SOLID pricniples
